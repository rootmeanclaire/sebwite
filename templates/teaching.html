	<h2>CS 010A Slides</h2>
	<p>CS 010A (formerly CS 010) is the first UC Riverside&rsquo;s intro to programming series of engineering majors. It covers C++ programming concepts from complete basics up until introducing the concept of classes. Object oriented programming is covered more completely in CS 010B (formerly CS 012).</p>
	<p>I worked as a TA for three lab sections in Fall quarter (September 26 â€“ December 13) of 2024. My duties included preparing slides of the information to be covered for the week&rsquo;s &ldquo;labs&rdquo; (programming assignments) and assist them in completing them.</p>
